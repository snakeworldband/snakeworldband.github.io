    <h2>so heres the deal with snakeworld!</h2>
	<p>willow and raine formed snakeworld! in mid 2023 as the latest of their music collaborations, and, not long after, were joined by alex and aurelia on drums and bass respectively. currently, we're recording our first
	ep and getting ready for our first live show on november 4th 2023! come see us :)
	<br>
	<br>
	inspired by bands such as the moldy peaches, nana grizol, and the halo benders, snakeworld! (hopefully) brings joy and good vibes to the world of punk and twee pop. all of our members are listed below, with a little blurb
	written by each of us
